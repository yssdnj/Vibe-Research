> An open dashboard for China A-share (plus US / HK): it wires up all the data and plugs into **your own AI / agent** — it never recommends a stock. You bring the model, it brings the data.

Vibe-Research is an open-source research dashboard built primarily for **China A-share**, with US and HK markets included (A-share traders usually check overnight Wall Street and Hong Kong first, so the data is wired up too).

It does not make decisions for you. It pulls together quotes, analyst reports, valuation, financials, filings, fund flows and news into one clean dashboard, then leaves an interface where **you plug in your own AI**. The direction and the conclusions come from the model or agent *you* configure.

## Features

| Page | What's in it |
|---|---|
| 📊&nbsp;**Daily&nbsp;Review** | Index quotes · **Global markets** (Dow / S&P / Nasdaq overnight + Hang Seng / HS Tech) · Watchlist quotes · **Short-term sentiment** (consecutive limit-up ladder, seal rate, break rate, promotion rate) · **Market-wide turnover top 20** · Market breadth · Sector fund-flow trends · Sector rotation · One-click AI review |
| 📡&nbsp;**News&nbsp;Radar** | 106 public RSS feeds across 12 tracks · AI-distilled "today's takeaways" · A-share filings and public news linked to your watchlist |
| 🌡️&nbsp;**Industry&nbsp;Signals** | One-line industry signals from zero-auth public endpoints, one sub-module added per release. **GPU rent**: **one-year daily price history** for B200 / H100 / A100 (500.farm grouped-median aggregate) · spot card = the latest point of the curve (same source, same math — the two numbers always agree; plus listed/total GPU counts and utilisation) · forward expectations (Kalshi public event contracts settled on the Ornn cross-platform index monthly average — **all listed settlement months covered**: a term-structure curve shows at a glance where the market expects rent to go, plus per-month **probability distribution, implied median and most-likely range**; settled months shown against actual outcomes) · the reading caveats are printed right on the page (spot "right now" vs. forward "monthly average" are different yardsticks — never subtract one from the other) · **a data snapshot ships with the repo**, so a fresh clone opens with full history and one refresh brings it up to date · price facts only, no "glut / shortage" verdicts |
| 🔍&nbsp;**Stock&nbsp;Data** | **A-share**: quotes · valuation matrix (forward PE / PEG) · **earnings snapshot** · valuation percentile vs. own 5-year history · key financials · analyst reports · filings · news · **fund flows** (margin trading, shareholder count, main-force flow, dividends, block trades) · top-list (Dragon-Tiger) · lockup expiry · sector membership · trending concepts · investor Q&A.<br>**US / HK / KR** (enter `AAPL` / `00700` / `005930.KS`): quotes · market cap · key financials (KR is quotes only) |
| ⚔️&nbsp;**Bull&nbsp;vs&nbsp;Bear** | **Multi-agent**: the backend first pulls a 13-item factual dossier, then a **bull researcher** and a **bear researcher** argue from that same data (optional rebuttal round), and a **neutral moderator** summarizes "what both sides agree on / where they actually disagree / what to verify / what data is missing". **Deliberately produces no buy or sell conclusion.**<br>⏱ Heavier than a chat: ~100s and 3 model calls per round — see [cost](#-what-one-debate-costs-read-before-you-run-it) first |
| ⭐&nbsp;**Watchlist** | **Paste a whole batch of tickers at once** (commas, spaces or newlines) · one-screen table (price, change, PE, PB, turnover) · **live quotes toggle** (top right, off by default; refreshes every 3s during trading hours, auto-pauses outside them and when the tab is hidden) · hand the whole list to your AI. Stored locally |
| 🧩&nbsp;**Sectors** | Sector and value-chain skeletons |
| 💼&nbsp;**Portfolio** | Enter cost and size, see live P&L · closed-position log (local only, never uploaded) |
| 📄&nbsp;**My Reports** | Drag-and-drop your own research PDFs / Word / spreadsheets · auto-filed by industry from the filename · download or delete. **Stored in your local deploy directory only** |
| 📝&nbsp;**Research Notes** | Save AI reviews, takeaways, Q&A and debates locally · **reflection audit**: have the AI audit its own reasoning — which claims are backed by data, which are speculation, where the weakest link is, and what to check next |
| 🔌&nbsp;**Bring Your AI** | Subscription mode (local CLI, no API key) · API mode (any OpenAI-compatible endpoint) · MCP (mount into Claude Code and other agents) |

> **Built-in analysis framework**: when your AI analyzes a stock it organizes findings across five dimensions — valuation, fund flows, earnings quality, industry cycle, catalysts and risks. The framework only prescribes *how to read the data*, never what to buy. The direction still comes from your own model.
>
> Limit-up lists and turnover rankings are **objective public data, presented as-is — no recommendation, no prediction**.

## Data Sources

Three public data toolkits are **vendored directly into this repo** — `git clone` and everything works, no extra downloads or wiring.

### A-share full-stack data · AStockData

- Lives in [`a-stock-data/`](a-stock-data/) (v3.7.1). Eleven data layers, 54 endpoints, 19 sources, with fallback sources when a primary one gets blocked. [`a-stock-data/SKILL.md`](a-stock-data/SKILL.md) **embeds every call as runnable code** — self-contained, with built-in rate limiting for Eastmoney endpoints.
- **Covers**: quotes / candles / analyst reports / consensus estimates / valuation / historical percentiles / financial statements / filings / Dragon-Tiger list / margin trading / block trades / shareholder counts / dividends / fund flows / lockup expiry / concept sectors / limit-up sentiment / ETF options / investor Q&A / market-wide industry rankings.
- **For agents**: running this repo with Claude Code or similar? Point them at `SKILL.md` — every endpoint has copy-paste ready code. The backend data layer (`backend/astock.py`) is ported from it.
- **Runtime deps**: `pip install mootdx requests pandas stockstats numpy baostock xlrd openpyxl` (akshare-free since v3.0; the last four were added in v3.7 for the new CYQ / valuation-history endpoints)
- **Upstream**: <https://github.com/simonlin1212/a-stock-data> — the vendored copy is a pinned snapshot and keeps working even if you never update it.

### US / HK data · global-stock-data

- Lives in [`global-stock-data/`](global-stock-data/) (v2.0.3). 13 data layers, 30+ endpoints, 11 sources, no auth required — quotes, candles, technicals, financial statements, fund flows, options (CBOE official chain with full Greeks and 0DTE flow), FINRA short volume, and the SEC EDGAR filing stream plus market-wide screener. Every source is labeled with its compliance tier.
- `backend/gstock.py` ports the Eastmoney-domain subset: global indices (the "Global markets" row on Daily Review) plus US/HK quotes and key financials.
- **Korean stocks**: append `.KS` to the 6-digit code (e.g. Samsung `005930.KS`). ⚠️ KR codes are also 6 digits like A-share tickers, so **the suffix is required** for correct routing. Quotes only, no financials. Taiwan is covered via US ADRs (e.g. `TSM`).
- **Upstream**: <https://github.com/simonlin1212/global-stock-data>

### Global news · investment-news

- 106 public RSS feeds across 12 industry tracks, merged into `backend/newsradar.py`. Standard library only, no API keys.
- **Upstream**: <https://github.com/simonlin1212/investment-news>

> All data comes from public sources. Vibe-Research only performs objective data aggregation and presents public rankings as-is — **it does not recommend stocks, predict price moves, time trades, or assign subjective scores**. What you do with the data is up to you and your AI.

## Architecture

One data layer, three AI outlets:

```
Vibe-Research/
├── a-stock-data/      A-share data toolkit (vendored v3.7.1, ready to use)
├── global-stock-data/ US / HK data toolkit (vendored v2.0.3, ready to use)
├── backend/           FastAPI :8900
│   ├── astock.py        A-share data
│   ├── gstock.py        US / HK data
│   ├── newsradar.py     News radar
│   ├── signals.py       Industry signals (GPU rent: Vast spot + 500.farm history + Kalshi forward)
│   ├── market.py        Market breadth + sector fund flows + global indices
│   ├── portfolio.py     Portfolio (stored in your local user directory)
│   ├── tools.py         AI tool layer (25 data tools, shared by chat / MCP / debate)
│   ├── chat.py          In-app AI (OpenAI-compatible function calling)
│   ├── debate.py        Bull-vs-bear orchestration (dossier → bull / bear / moderator)
│   ├── reflection.py    Reflection audit (audits reasoning in existing analysis)
│   └── mcp_server.py    MCP server (for Claude Code and other agents)
└── frontend/          Vite + React 19 + TS + Tailwind :5899
```

**Tiered dependencies**: quotes (Tencent) and reports/filings (Eastmoney) work with a minimal install. `akshare` / `mootdx` are imported lazily — if missing, only those endpoints return 501 with an install hint; the service still runs.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Backend (:8900)
cd backend && python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
.venv/bin/python -m uvicorn app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8900

# Frontend (:5899)
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:5899
```

## Bring Your Own AI

Configure once on the "Bring your AI" page and every AI feature across the dashboard uses your model. **All analysis comes from your model — this project does not tune or bias it.** Three options:

### 1. Subscription mode (uses a CLI you're already logged into — no API key)

Uses your existing subscription instead of paying per API call. Supported: **Claude Code · Codex · Qwen Code · DeepSeek CLI**.

- **Requirements**: the backend runs on your own machine, and the CLI is installed, logged in and on your `PATH`.
- Pick one on the "Bring your AI" page — no key needed.
- ⚠️ CLIs answer in one shot without multi-step tool calls, so this suits flows where the data is already prepared (daily review, takeaways, asking about the stock currently on screen). For open-ended questions where the AI should fetch data itself, use API mode.

### 2. API mode (bring your own key)

Pick a model and the base URL is filled in for you — just paste the key. Built-in presets for **DeepSeek / Doubao / MiniMax / OpenAI / OpenRouter / Groq / Together / MiMo / any OpenAI-compatible endpoint**. This mode supports function calling, so the AI fetches quotes, valuation, reports and news on its own. Your key stays in your browser's local storage and is sent only to your own backend.

### 3. MCP (for Claude Code and other agents)

Mount the backend as an MCP server so your agent can call Vibe-Research's data tools with its own subscription. See [`backend/README.md`](backend/README.md).

## How the Multi-Agent Part Is Designed

Open-source multi-agent finance frameworks (TradingAgents, ai-hedge-fund and friends) end their pipeline with a trader or portfolio_manager role that outputs "buy / sell / how much". **This project deliberately omits that layer.**

Here the endpoint of the multi-agent flow is **disagreement**, not a verdict:

```
① Factual dossier   backend pulls 13 objective datasets (no LLM involved)
                     ↓  both sides argue over the same data — nobody can win by making numbers up
② Bull researcher   builds the case: thesis + supporting evidence + what must hold for it to work
③ Bear researcher   builds the counter-case: doubts + risk evidence + what must hold for it to work
   (optional)       rebuttal round: address each point, concede what's conceded, refute with data
④ Neutral moderator shared ground / real disagreements (missing data or differing reads?) /
                     what to verify / what data is absent
```

Deliberate constraints:

- **Dossier first** — the model isn't left to remember which tool to call. Data is deterministic and reproducible; missing items are stated in the dossier with an explicit "do not speculate" instruction.
- **Every claim must cite the specific data it rests on**; anything unsupported must be labeled as such.
- **The moderator does not pick a winner** and gives no rating or lean — its output is "here's what to look at next".
- Rate-limited endpoints are fetched **serially**: the throttle is timestamp-based rather than lock-based, so concurrency would blow straight through it.

### What one debate costs (read before you run it)

A debate is much heavier than a chat — it runs a full pipeline and **every role carries the complete dossier**. Measured:

| | 1 round | 2 rounds (with rebuttal) |
|---|---|---|
| Model calls | **3** | **5** |
| Input sent | ~35k CJK chars | ~60k |
| Output | ~4k | ~7k |
| Wall clock | **~100–120s** | ~3 min |

Roughly 35s of that is fetching the dossier — a dozen public endpoints, **zero tokens**. The rest is generation.

**To keep costs down:**

1. **One round is usually enough.** Two rounds doubles everything.
2. **Prefer subscription mode** (local CLI) over an API key.
3. **A debate doesn't need an expensive model.** The data is already in the dossier; the model only organizes and expresses it. Save your budget for your own deep questions.
4. **Don't spam it.** The dossier hits a dozen throttled endpoints.

### Reflection audit

The same idea applied to writing you already have: audit the reasoning and surface the parts that *sound* reasonable but aren't backed by anything. In testing it reliably catches things like "widely recognized by institutions" (generalizing from three data points) or "frequently raised estimates" (never quantified).

Much cheaper — **a single model call** over the text you selected.

## Tests

```bash
cd backend && .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
.venv/bin/pytest -m "not live"   # offline unit + API tests (fast, no network)
.venv/bin/pytest -m live         # verifies live data source shapes (run before releases)
```

## Changelog

See [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md). The single source of truth for the version is `frontend/package.json`; the backend API, the UI and the MCP `serverInfo` all read from it.

## Compliance

- Objective data aggregation and public-ranking display only: **no stock recommendations, no price predictions, no trade timing, no return promises, no subjective scoring.** Neutral by design.
- Limit-up lists and turnover rankings are **objective public data** (the same numbers Eastmoney and Tonghuashun publish); the product displays them as-is with nothing attached.
- All analytical direction comes from the AI *you* configure, not from this project. There are no buy/sell buttons in the UI, and valuation percentiles mark position only — no lines suggesting when to act.
- **Your portfolio, watchlist, uploaded reports and API keys stay on your machine.** Nothing is uploaded; nothing enters the repo.
- Portfolio and uploaded reports default to `~/.vibe-research/` (override with `VR_DATA_DIR` / `VR_REPORTS_DIR`) — outside the project folder, so re-downloading or overwriting the project never loses your data.
