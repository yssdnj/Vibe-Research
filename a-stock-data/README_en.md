Full-stack data toolkit for China A-Share market — 11-layer architecture · 54 endpoints (51 primary + 3 official backups) · 19 data sources · direct HTTP calls except two TCP client libraries (mootdx / baostock)

A self-contained Skill file that consolidates raw A-share data from 19 sources into a ready-to-use toolkit for AI coding assistants. No need to memorize mootdx candlestick parameters, Eastmoney PDF Referer headers, or iwencai X-Claw authentication — it's all handled. And when a primary source bans you, there's a backup-source quick reference to fall back on.

> Compatible with [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) · [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) · [OpenClaw](https://github.com/anthropics/openclaw)
>
> The Skill file is structured Markdown + embedded Python. Any AI coding assistant with context injection can use it.

---

## Quick Start

**3 steps, 2 minutes.**

```bash
# 1. Create skill directory
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/a-stock-data

# 2. Download SKILL.md
curl -o ~/.claude/skills/a-stock-data/SKILL.md \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simonlin1212/a-stock-data/main/SKILL.md

# 3. Install dependencies (V3.0: akshare no longer needed)
pip install mootdx requests pandas stockstats numpy baostock xlrd openpyxl
```

Launch Claude Code and say "Check the valuation of 688017" — the skill activates automatically.

> **Codex / OpenClaw users:** Paste the contents of SKILL.md into your system prompt or project context file. The embedded Python code is ready to execute.

---

## 54 Endpoints

> **Counting convention:** the tables below have 55 rows but count as 54 endpoints — "Eastmoney Industry Reports" shares **the same endpoint** as "Eastmoney reportapi" (only the `qType` parameter differs) and "THS Northbound (historical)" is a local self-built cache (not a separate endpoint), so neither is counted; the single "EM Intraday Anomaly Pool" row covers **two** endpoints (`list` / `count`), adding one back. 55 − 1 − 1 + 1 = 54.

## V3.7 Highlights

**1 new data layer, 7 new endpoints, 4 new sources** (baostock / SW Research / PBoC / NBS — all zero-registration, zero-key). Every endpoint was run and verified on 2026-08-19.

| Gap it closes | Endpoint | Verified |
|---|---|---|
| **"Chip layer" was a misnomer** — §4.1~4.5 were all capital-flow data, no actual chip distribution | Chip Distribution (CYQ) | Eastmoney has **no** public CYQ endpoint (`push2`/`push2his` both 404 in testing); computed locally from OHLC + turnover, zero new sources |
| **Valuation was same-day snapshot only** | Valuation History | **2,581 rows** of daily PE/PB/PS/PCF for Moutai since 2016-01-04, plus turnover / suspension / ST (000004 shows 276 ST days) |
| **K-line is unadjusted — cross-ex-div comparisons break** | Adjust Factors qfq/hfq | One HTTP call, ~1.8KB; ⚠️ **qfq divides, hfq multiplies** — wrong direction fails silently with wrong numbers |
| **No way to get delisting dates** | Listing / Delisting | Only zero-auth source; lets you drop zombie tickers at the screening stage |
| **Industry was current-only → look-ahead bias** | SW Industry History | **12,893 rows / 5,905 tickers / 38 level-1 industries**; Ping An Bank verified across 1991→2014→2021 |
| **No macro layer at all** | Social Financing + PMI | Social financing monthly, 12 columns (2026-01 flow: 7,218.5bn CNY); PMI 2026-07 manufacturing 49.2 |

> ⚠️ **New dependencies:** `numpy baostock xlrd openpyxl`. baostock is a TCP client library (no registration, no key)
> and **does not support the Beijing Exchange** — codes starting 4/8/92/920 are rejected server-side, so this
> toolkit blocks them before login and raises `ValueError`.

---

## Data Source Priority (V3.2 re-ranked by IP-ban risk)

> **Principle: anything available from mootdx or Tencent (quotes / K-line / live price / market cap / financials) must use them first (never IP-banned). Eastmoney is only for its exclusive data, all routed through the throttled `em_get()`.**

| Priority | Source | Protocol | IP Ban Risk | Use |
|----------|--------|----------|-------------|-----|
| **1 (top)** | mootdx (TDX) | TCP 7709 | **Never banned** | K-line / order book / ticks / financials / F10 |
| **2 (top)** | Tencent Finance | HTTP | **Never banned** | Live price / PE / PB / market cap / turnover / index / ETF |
| 3 | THS Hot Stocks / Northbound | HTTP | Very low (zero auth) | Hot stocks / themes / northbound flow |
| 4 | Baidu Finance | HTTP | Very low | K-line (w/ MA5/10/20) |
| 5 | Sina Finance | HTTP | Low | Financial statements |
| 6 | cninfo | HTTP | Low | Filings |
| 7 | THS Consensus EPS | HTTP | Low (UA required) | Consensus EPS |
| 8 | iwencai | OpenAPI | Low (key required) | NL semantic search |
| 9 | **baostock** | TCP | Low (no registration) | Valuation history PE/PB/PS/PCF + turnover + suspension + ST + listing/delisting dates (**no Beijing Exchange**) |
| 10 | **SW Research** | HTTP | Low (public XLS) | Industry classification history |
| 11 | **PBoC** | HTTP | Low (official site) | Aggregate social financing |
| 12 | **NBS** | HTTP | Low (official site) | PMI |
| **last (exclusive only)** | **Eastmoney** datacenter/push2/reportapi/search/np-weblist | HTTP | **Medium — has rate-limit risk** | Dragon-tiger / lockup / margin / block trade / shareholders / dividends / fund flow / reports / news (all via `em_get()`) |

> **Architecture:** Except mootdx and baostock (both TCP client libraries), all sources use direct HTTP API calls with no third-party data wrapper in between. **Eastmoney APIs are rate-limited; all calls go through `em_get()` for serial throttling. For batch jobs, increase `EM_MIN_INTERVAL`.**
>
> **Fallback (V3.4 new):** When any primary source is banned or broken, check the "Backup Sources & Fallback Strategy" section in SKILL.md — every data category has an independent backup on a **different domain and rate-limit plane** (SSE/SZSE official / Sina / THS / HKEX), unaffected when Eastmoney bans you.
